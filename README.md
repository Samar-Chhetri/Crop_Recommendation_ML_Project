# Crop Recommendation System ( End to End Machine Learning Project )

Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Here, I present you a dataset which would allow the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

#### Project Overview
I have extracted the dataset from MYSQL server hosted locally.
After ingesting the data, I have performed data transformation, preprocessing and finally built a model. I have used Scikit-learn for training models. I have choosen best model among different models. Using Flask, I have created a simple web-page to deploy the model.
